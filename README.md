# meteor todos example with bootstrap3

This is the updated source code from meteor's todos example.
It was worked out as a showcase to check out how to use bootstrap3 for frontend
elements instead of _old-style_ web layout.

Please checkout also smaller displays like phones and tablets for minimized
menu layout.

This app was done on meteor 0.8.1.3
